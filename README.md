Various repos for various projects, some science, some literature, some just for fun

**Current Active Project**: _History Survival Guide_ ⚗️👩🏽‍🚀🧮👨🏽‍🚀🔭

This is an exploration into science history–sometimes more science, sometimes more history. A science and history blog that explores scientific concepts with practical information about how to recreate and use the techniques described in any time period. The History Survival Guide (or,  A Time Traveler’s Guide to Surviving History) has been updating since July 2019. Each page is the accumulation of research for a particular topic, synthesized and summarized in a useful ‘survival guide’ format
