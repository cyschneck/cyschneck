### Howdy!

Here you'll find the repos for my projects: some earth science, some astronomy, and some just for fun

**PyPi Python Packages** 🐍

- **[pip install pydar](https://pypi.org/project/pydar/)**: Access, download, view, and manipulate Cassini RADAR images of Saturn’s moon Titan in one place 🛰️🐍
- **[pip install centerline-width](https://pypi.org/project/centerline-width/)**: Find the centerline and width of rivers based on the latitude and longitude of the right and left bank 🌊🐍
- **[pip install star-chart-spherical-projection](https://pypi.org/project/star-chart-spherical-projection/)**: Generate circular star charts (past and future) based on spherical projection that corrects for distortions with stereographic projection for stars, accurate over 400,000 years with proper motion and precession of the equinoxes ⭐🐍
- **[pip install muller-eot](https://pypi.org/project/muller-eot/)**: Calculate and graph the Equation of Time minute differences from separate and arbitrary eccentricity and obliquity 🕰️🐍

*Try it Out:*

A Flask application is running at [cyschneck.pythonanywhere.com](http://cyschneck.pythonanywhere.com/) with a basic front-end to to demonstrate the functionality of the star-chart-spherical-projection and muller-eot Python PyPi packages

This is an exploration into science history–sometimes more science, sometimes more history. A science and history blog that explores scientific concepts with practical information about how to recreate and use the techniques described in any time period. Each page is the accumulation of research for a particular topic, synthesized and summarized in a useful ‘survival guide’ format. So far, topics covered included using the proper motion of stars to determine what time period a time traveler could have found themselves in, deciphering ‘Hobo Symbols’ of the 1800’s, and how to read the Pioneer Plaque. All pages are done in a pulp science fiction aesthetic.
