### Howdy!

Here you'll find the repos for my projects: some earth science, some astronomy, and some just for fun

**PyPi Python Packages** 🐍

- **[pip install centerline-width](https://pypi.org/project/centerline-width/)**: Find the centerline and width of rivers based on the latitude and longitude of the right and left bank 🌊🐍
- **[pip install pydar](https://pypi.org/project/pydar/)**: Access, download, view, and manipulate Cassini RADAR images of Saturn’s moon Titan in one place 🛰️🐍
- **[pip install star-chart-spherical-projection](https://pypi.org/project/star-chart-spherical-projection/)**: Generate astronomy star charts that corrects for distortions with stereographic projection ⭐🐍
- **[pip install muller-eot](https://pypi.org/project/muller-eot/)**: Calculate and graph the Equation of Time minute differences from separate and arbitrary eccentricity and obliquity 🕰️🐍

**[History Survival Guide](https://github.com/cyschneck/History-Survival-Guide)** ⚗️👩🏽‍🚀🧮👨🏽‍🚀🔭

A science and history blog to explore science with practical information about how to recreate and use the techniques described. Each topic is the accumulation of research, synthesized and summarized in a useful ‘survival guide’ format

So far, topics include using the proper motion of stars to determine what time period a time traveler could have found themselves in, deciphering the Pioneer Plaque, and how to construct an astrolabe by hand. All pages are done in a pulp science fiction aesthetic
