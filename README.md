**Current Active Project**: _History Survival Guide_

This is an exploration into science historyâ€“sometimes more science, sometimes more history. A science and history blog that explores scientific concepts with practical information about how to recreate and use the techniques described in any time period. The History Survival Guide (or,  A Time Travelerâ€™s Guide to Surviving History) has been updating since July 2019. Each page is the accumulation of research for a particular topic, synthesized and summarized in a useful â€˜survival guideâ€™ format
