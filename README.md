- **[pip install star-chart-spherical-projection](https://pypi.org/project/star-chart-spherical-projection/)**: Generate star charts (past and future) with spherical projection to overcome spherical distortions with hundreds of named stars over 400,000 years while accounting star movement with proper motion and precession of the equinoxes ⭐🐍
- **[pip install muller-eot](https://pypi.org/project/muller-eot/)**: Calculate and graph the Equation of Time minute differences from an arbitrary eccentricity and obliquity 🕰️🐍

*Try it Out:*

A basic Flask application is running at [cyschneck.pythonanywhere.com](http://cyschneck.pythonanywhere.com/) as a front-end to to demonstrate the functionality of the  star-chart-spherical-projection and muller-eot Python packages
