[![ReadMe Card](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=cyschneck&repo=History-Survival-Guide)](https://github.com/cyschneck/History-Survival-Guide)

A science and history blog to explore science with practical information about how to recreate and use the techniques described. Each topic is the accumulation of research, synthesized and summarized in a useful ‘survival guide’ format

So far, topics include using the proper motion of stars to determine what time period a time traveler could have found themselves in, deciphering the Pioneer Plaque, and how to construct an astrolabe by hand. All pages are done in a pulp science fiction aesthetic
